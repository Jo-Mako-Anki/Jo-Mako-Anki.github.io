          <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This page will give you an introduction on how japanese works. <br>
            <b> The sentence structure </b>is based on Cure Dolly's lessons. Even if you already started learning japanese, I recommend reading it. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="scrollable" id="Writing Systems">
            <h2>Writing Systems</h2>
The japanese writing systems is made with 3 kind of characters: Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana.<br>Hiragana and Katakana represent sound, so they are always pronounced the same way, but there are used differently.<div><br>Katakana is used for foreign words (テレビ: "Terebi" = TV) so it's less frequent.<br><br>Here's an example: <br>アメリカ　人　です。<br>America - person - "is".<br><br>Pronouns can be omitted in japanese. like in this example. So this sentence could mean "I am american" or "He/She is american".<br><br>アメリカ (A-Me-Ri-Ka) is written in Katakana, like most foreign words.<br>人 (Jin) is a Kanji. It means person.<br>です (~ is) is written in Hiragana.</div>
              <h3>Hiragana</h3>             
              For the sake of simplification, consider that everything can be written in hiragana.<br><br>Hiragana Chart : 
              <div style=" background: white;"><img src="../../../assets/courses/HiraganaChart.png"></div>
              <h3>Katakana</h3>  
              Katakana is used mostly for foreign words or onomatopoeia.<br><br>It's the same sounds as hiraganas but written differently.<br>It's more rigid in appearance.<br>Like so : ひらがな (Hi Ra Ga Na) - カタカナ (Ka Ta Ka Na)<br><br>Katakana Chart:   
              <div style="    background: white;"><img src="../../../assets/courses/KatakanaChart.png"></div>
              <h3>Kanji</h3>
              Kanjis are characters borrowed from chinese.<br>They can represent an idea/concept, a sound or both.<br>They can be read in different very ways.<br><br>私 can be read わたし (watashi) or あたし (atashi).<br><br>You can think about them like emoticons :<br>I ❤️ japanese from the bottom of my ❤️.<br>❤️ is written the same but have different readings (love and heart in this exemple).<br><br>The reading are divided in two categories :<br>- on'yomi (from Chinese)<br>- kun'yomi (native Japanese) <br><br>Some kanjis can have a lot of different readings. That's why it's often recommended in your studies to only focus on the concept/meaning. and learn readings in the context of vocabulary. <br>However, there are a lot of different opinions on what is the "best way" to study kanjis.<br><br>Kanjis are made of small parts called radicals. <br>明 : bright (日: sun + 月: moon)<br><br>Those radicals can be Kanjis themselves.<br>- 山 (mountain)<br>- 木 (tree)<br>- 火 (fire).
              <h3>Furigana</h3>
              We saw that Kanji have different readings.<br><br>To help knowing how to read the kanji, there can be the reading written above the Kanji.<br>It's written in hiragana and is called furigana.
              <h3>Rōmaji</h3>
              Rōmaji  is a way to write japanese sound in english alphabet.<br>It exists so you can pronounce japanese without being able to read it.<br>Example : ありがと (japanese) = arigato (rōmaji).

            <section class="scrollable" id="About the language">
            <h2>About the language</h2>
            The Japanese language possesses a speech-level hierarchy that determines how one should address any given person based on various factors: relationship, age, role, respect, etc.<br><br>Typically, Japanese learners are first introduced to polite speech. This is because polite speech is what is used in most daily interactions.<br><br>However, the greatest flaw made by introducing polite speech first lies in the fact that it is not the base form of speech.<br>Politeness is an auxiliary element to conversation. The purpose is not to provide information other than social implications.<br><br>Grammatically, plain speech is what makes up the base form of the language.<br>It's the basis for conjugation, to which politeness is then added.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, the longer the word (with a prefix like お) or the sentence, the more respectful it is.
            <h3>Polite Suffix</h3>
            Japanese use differents honorifics, usually attached to the name. <br><br>Sama <br>The most formal honorific suffix is -sama, and it’s used for God (kami-sama) and royalty (ohime-sama).<br><br>San<br>The most common formal honorific is -san, it translates (approimately) to Ms. and Mr. .<br><br>Chan<br>This is an endearing female honorific. While it’s most commonly used for children, it’s also used fairly widely among family and friends.<br><br>Kun<br>This is the male equivalent of –chan, it’s used for kids and between peers and friends.<br><br>You'll also find the prefix お (O) and ご (Go) beforn noun to make it sound more polite.
            <h3>Gender and plural</h3>
            There is no gender and plural in japanese.<br>It is understood by context. <br>In short sentences given as examples, more than one translation are possible.<br><br>学生 can mean student or students, and the student(s) can be a boy or girl.
            <h3>Pronouns</h3>
            Japanese usually avoid pronouns and use the person's name instead.

            <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
            
            <section class="scrollable" id="Particles">
              <h3>Particles</h3>
                <div>In english, word order is very important to understand the meaning of a sentence.</div><div><u>Ex:</u>　John eats an apple　/　An apple eats John.</div><div><br></div><div>In Japanese however, word order is more flexible than in English.<br></div>That's because information is structured around <b>particles</b>.<br><br><div>Particles, not word order, are what determines how each part of a sentence relates to the verb.<div>They are placed after the word they are attached to.<br><u>Ex:</u> John<b>が</b> apple<b>を </b>eat.　/　Apple<b>を</b> John<b>が</b> eat.</div><div><br></div><div>The particle <b>が</b> tells us that "John" is the one doing the action, and the particle <b>を</b> tells us that the verb applies to "apple".</div><div>Changing the word order didn't change the meaning of the sentence.&nbsp;</div><div><i>Note that this is for the sake of explanation and you'll never see a sentence structured like the second example.</i></div><div><br>A usual japanese sentence names a subject, objects marked by particles and ends with the verb.<br></div></div>
              </section>

            <section class="scrollable" id="The particle が">
                <h3>The particle が</h3>
                A lot of confusion happen for japanese learners between the 2 particles は and が.<div>Textbooks usually start by making sentences using は because it's more common. The first lesson is usually A　は　B, translated as A is B.</div><div>However this gives the misconception that は means =.</div><div><br></div><div>So instead, we'll take the Cure Dolly's youtube channel approach.&nbsp;</div><div>It's more logical to start learning japanese by learning が first.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's consider that any sentence is either:</div><div>- A does B (B is a verb)<br></div><div>- A is B (B is either a noun or an adjective)</div><div><br></div><div>We can add more information about A or B to have longer sentences.</div><div>What's important is that the link between the two is made with the particle <b>が</b>.</div><div><b>が marks the doer of the action or the subject we're describing.</b></div><div><br></div><div><div>This is important to remember because future lesson will translate some grammar that will contradict it from the english point of view.</div><div>For example: I like X.　/　Xが 好き。<br></div><div>In english, "I" is the doer of the action, liking X.</div><div>In japanese, it's not "I" that is marked by が but "X".</div></div><div>Meaning is "X" is the doer of the action by being desirable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This will help making sense of all japanese sentences in the future.<br></div><div>が marks the subject of the sentence.</div>
              </section>

            <section class="scrollable" id="Type of sentences">
                <h3>Type of sentences</h3>
                <h4>Verb Sentences</h4><div><u>Ex:</u> 桜が<b>歩く</b>　/　Sakuraが <b>Aruku</b>　/　Sakura walks</div><div><br></div><div>This is a simple A does B sentence.&nbsp;</div><div>In japanese, the verb always goes at the end of the sentence.</div> <br><h4>Noun / Copula Sentences</h4><div><u>Ex:</u> 桜が日本人<b>だ</b>　/　Sakuraが Nihonjin <b>だ</b>　/　Sakura is japanese</div><div><br></div><div>This is a simple A is B sentence.</div><div>The copula states that something is, like an equal sign. A=B</div><div>However it's not the verb to be. We'll see more about it soon.</div> <br> <h4>Adjective Sentences</h4><div><u>Ex:</u> ペンが赤<b>い</b>　/　Penが　aka<b>i</b>　/　The pen is red</div><div><br></div><div>Another A is B sentence.</div><div>You'll notice that the sentence doesn't end with だ.</div><div>This is because 赤 (noun) means red, but 赤い (い-adjective) means "is red".</div><div>Consider that the da function, the equals function, is already built into those i-adjectives.</div><div> <br> <h4>Conclusion</h4></div><div>There are two kind of sentences :&nbsp;</div><div>- A does B&nbsp;</div><div>B is the verb: Aが B.</div><div><br></div><div>- A is B</div><div>B is a noun: Aが B　だ.<br></div><div>B is an adjective (only い-adjective): Aが　B.<br></div>

            <section class="scrollable" id="Negative Sentences">
                <h3>Negative Sentences</h3>
                To express a sentence in the negative form we use the い-adjective ない.<div>It means nonexistent, not being.<br><div><br></div><div>Let's see our 3 types of sentences once more.</div><div> <br><h4>Verb Sentences</h4><div>桜が<b>歩く</b>　/　Sakuraが&nbsp;<b>Aruku</b>　/　Sakura walks<br></div><div>桜が<b>歩かない</b>　/　Sakuraが&nbsp;<b>Arukanai</b>　/　Sakura does not walk</div><div><br></div><div> <h4>Adjective Sentences</h4><div>ペンが赤<b>い</b>　/　Penが　aka<b>i</b>　/　The pen is red</div></div><div>ペンが赤<b>くない</b>　/　Penが　aka<b>i</b>　/　The pen is not red<br></div> <br><h4>Noun / Copula Sentences</h4><div>桜が日本人<b>だ</b>　/　Sakuraが Nihonjin&nbsp;<b>だ</b>　/　Sakura is japanese</div><div>桜が日本人<b>ではない</b>　/　Sakuraが Nihonjin&nbsp;<b>だ</b>　/　Sakura is japanese</div></div></div><div> <br><h4>Conclusion</h4></div><div>We'll see how the verbs, adjective and copula conjugate in detail for their respective lesson, but for now, just notice that we attach ない.<br></div>  
              </section>

            <section class="scrollable" id="Omission">
              <h3>Omission</h3>
              In japanese, you can convey a lot of information with a few words.<br>Context, or social awareness plays a massive part in understanding the language.<br><br>Pronouns are usually omitted in japanese, the meaning of the sentence relies on the context of the situation.<div><div><br></div><div>Ex: ジョン だ can mean I'm John, he's John or it's John.</div><div><br></div><div>The actual sentence could be (私が)　ジョン　だ. (I'm) John.</div><div>But if someone ask for you name and you reply ジョンだ, the person will know you're talking about yourself. No need for pronoun.</div><div><br></div><div>But it goes further than just pronouns.</div><div>Ex:&nbsp; 土曜日 だ can mean it's monday, today is monday, the party is on monday...</div><div>Full sentence could use todayが or partyが, but it has been omitted.</div><div><br></div><div>Same goes with verbs.</div><div>- 食べる can mean I'm eating, or she's eating, or they're eating...</div><div><br></div><div>What's important to remember, is that the information is still there, we just don't need to mention it.</div><div>It becomes more important later one when you have longer sentences.</div></div>
            </section>

            <section class="scrollable" id="The particle は">
                <h3>The particle は</h3>
                We saw that particles give information and meaning to the sentence: が is the subject, を receive the action of the verb, we'll see particles for time, places ...<div><br></div><div>は is a particle that indicates the topic of the sentence.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But it's important to understand that's it's not the subject, but the topic.<br></div><div>Which leads to confusion with が.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>私が</b>　ジョン　だ　/　<b>I am</b> John.</div><div><b>私は</b>　ジョン　だ　/　<b>As for me</b>, (I am) John.</div><div><br></div><div>So what's the difference ?</div><div>Let's say that you're within a group ordering food and it's your turn to order.</div><div><br></div><div><b>私が</b>　すし　だ　/　I am a sushi.</div><div><b>私は</b>　すし　だ　/　<b>As for me</b>, (it's) sushi.<br></div><div><br></div><div>We know that pronoun depends on context, in the first case, it's the same, "私" (<b>I</b>).</div><div>But in the second example, the pronoun is "<b>it</b>".</div><div>私 is the topic of the sentence but the subject is the invisible "it".</div><div><br></div><div>Most textbooks start japanese with the sentence "A は B だ" and tell you that&nbsp; it means A is B.<br>But as you can see, it's not always the case.<br></div><div><br></div><div>は doesn't influence the meaning of the sentence, it only puts an emphasis because it indicates the topic.</div>
              </section>

            <section class="scrollable" id="Clauses">
                <h3>Clauses</h3>
                We saw there are 3 types of sentences depending on how they end: verb, い-adjective, copula.<div><br></div><div>That entire sentence can in turn be used as a noun.</div><div>So we had A does B or A is B.&nbsp;</div><div>We can make BA does C or BA is C.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div> <h4>Verb Sentences</h4><div><font color="#ffff7f">女が</font>　<font color="#5555ff">歌る</font>　　　　　　The woman sings.</div><div><font color="#00ff7f">歌る　女が</font>　食べる　　The singing woman eats.
