          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <h2>About the guide</h2>
          <p>
            This is not a guide <b>to learn</b> japanese but a guide about <b>how to learn</b> japanese. It's made for
            absolute beginners, but those more advanced may find some useful information as well. 
          </p><br />
          <p>
            I don't really like the guides that try to sell you a unique method or pathway.<br />
            We all have different tastes, interests and amount of free time for one method to apply to us all. <br>
            I've seen countless 
            people say they struggle or even stopped to learn japanese because using one of those so called "best way to learn japanese" didn't 
            didn't work for them, and they got demotivated.<br />
            <br>
            If you're interested, here's a short video from someone who actually studied if polyglottes have a common "best" method to learn languages.<br>
            <iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_XVt5rdpFY">
            </iframe>
          </p><br />
          <p>
            So, this guide won't tell you what to do, but will show you a list of the most
            popular tools and resources that we have at our disposal.<br>
            I'll explain advantages and disadvantages for each of them and can you pick the ones that suits you the best.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            I'm biased to some resources, of course, but I try to be honest and subjective. I'm sure some people would
            disagree with me when it comes to kanji and immersion, but that's okay. 
            <br>
            Keep in mind that the list of
            methods in this guide is not exhaustive, you can obviously study in ways that are not presented here.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>In the end, japanese is no different than any languages. You have 4 skills that you can develop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Input</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Listening</li>
              <li>Reading</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Output</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Speaking</li>
              <li>Writing</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You'll need to study grammar (including conjugation), vocabulary and immerse in native content. The only thing
            special from other languages are kanji, but just think of them as vocabulary.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the resources mentionned are listed on my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukDIWSkh_xvpppPbgs1nUR2kaEwFaWlsJgZUlb9LuTs/edit#gid=818343474" 
            target="_blank">
            spreadsheet</a>, so you can just read the guide to get an overview, 
            and uses the list later.

          <h2>Don't get lost or demotivated</h2>
            <h3>Set your goal</h3>
              <p>Not everybody wants to study japanase for the same reasons. Find some goals that works for you.</p>
            <h3>Set smaller goals to keep track of progress</h3>
          <p>
            Learning a language is a long road. Divide it into some smaller goals and track your progress. It will give
            you a sense a progression. When feeling demotivated you can look back at all the things you have already
            achieved.
          </p>
          <h3>Don't compare yourself to others</h3>
          <p>
            You don't fail because others are going faster than you. You still going faster than anyone who didn't even
            try or gave up. Either way, nobody can study for you anyway. Focus on your own progress.
          </p>
          <h2>Terms that will be used in this guide</h2>
          <h3>Frequency</h3>
          <p>
            Frequency refers to how often something happenens over a limited period of time. Usually how often do you
            see a word / kanji in an episode or a book. Frequency list will make sure you focus on the most important
            words instead of learning vocabulary that will appear just once.
          </p>
          <h3>SRS</h3>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition system. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while
            older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently. This way you can make your study sessions
            more efficient.
          </p>
          <h3>Anki</h3>
          <p>
            Free SRS software. Basically a flashcards software, but it can do so much more when you install the addons,
            especially Morphman. Check the <a href="morphman.html">guide page</a> to see how to set it up. It's crucial
            for you to understand the learning steps in the settings.
          </p>
          <h2>Solutions to problems you could have right now</h2>
          <h3>Web plugins to translate every word</h3>
          <p>
            Rikaichamp (mozilla) or Rikaikun (Chrome) are web plugins allowing you to have a pop up dictionary by
            hovering over words or kanji. Don't forget that you can open any text file (like subtiltes) in a browser,
            making it easier to read japanese.
          </p>
          <h3>Jp / Eng dictionary</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">Jisho</a> is the most commonly used. Take 2 minutes to read the
            instructions on the website. You can set up your searches in a lot of ways.
          </p>
          <h3>Website to translate whole sentences (with conjugations)</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of looking up words one by one, translate the whole sentence at once with
            <a href="https://ichi.moe/" target="_blank">ichi.moe</a>. Every word will be given the kanji, kana, romaji
            and definition. Works with conjugation way better than jisho.
          </p>
          <h3>Create a Frequency list from almost anything</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/japanesetextana/" target="_blank">Japanese Text Analysis</a>. A
            bit old but still the best option to create frequency list on the fly. Otherwise, use Morphman's Analyzer.
          </p>

        <section class="scrollable" id="before-you-start">
          <h2>General tips before you start</h2>
          <h3>Grammar, kanji, vocabulary or conjugation or ... ?</h3>
          <p>
            At the start, try to mix them up. You'll remember a kanji better if it's used in a word. You'll learn
            vocabulary and grammar better in a context of a sentence. You can focus more on a specific field, but don't
            put any of them on the side until you have "finished" one.
          </p>
          <h3>Use the Resources page</h3>
          <p>
            You can find them on <a href="resources.html">this page</a> and in a
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukDIWSkh_xvpppPbgs1nUR2kaEwFaWlsJgZUlb9LuTs/edit#gid=818343474"
              target="_blank"
              >google spreadsheet</a
            >
            that you can filter depending on your level or what you want to focus on. The list is small. You can always
            search on reddit for more.
          </p>
          <h3>Search before you ask</h3>
          <p>
            If you're looking for something or have a question, chances are it's been asked and answered on
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
            before. Just look for it before asking.It's faster to find an answer than waiting for one. If you didn't
            find an answer, feel free to join the
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/" target="_blank">Discord server</a> and ask.
          </p>

          <h2>Get a 5 minute overview</h2>
          <p>
            Check the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/f1fPDZk" target="_blank">introduction on Imgur</a> taken from my
            grammar deck. It will give you an overview of how japanese works. Kana, conjugation, grammar, kanji. You
            don't have to memorize anything yet, just read it to get familiar with the concepts.
