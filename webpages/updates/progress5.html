              It's been a while. <br>
              No introduction, let's get to the new stuff.
            </p>
          </section>


         <h2>ANKI DECKS</h2>   
         <section class="scrollable" id="ANKI DECKS"> 

          <h3>More premade anime</h3>
          <section class="scrollable" id="Anime Anki Deck"> 
           <p> 
            31 new decks, so I'm not gonna list them all, but mostly the missing Ghibli movies, and some popular anime. <br>
            Which means that I've made in total 99 decks. Good number to stop.<br>
            I don't plan on making more, exept for the last part of Attack on Titan when it comes out.<br>
            Maybe some Kurosawa movies at some point. Maybe.<br>
            <img src="../../assets/progress/5/progress5_1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="">
            All this was done so I could have more examples for my core anime deck.<br>
          </p>
          </section>

          <h3>Core Anime Anki deck</h3>
          <section class="scrollable" id="Core Anime Anki deck"> 
           <p> 
            Core Anime 2K Anki deck<br>
            What's this ?<br>
            If you haven't tried it, it's a vocabulary deck where you learn words by frequency order, each sentence containing only one new word at a time.<br>
            Order and examples are based on anime.<br>
            After finishing the new anime decks, I had made a total of 99 decks, which I used a bank example for this one.<br>
            So I started the deck from scratch so I could have more anime / examples to choose from.<br><br>
            <img src="../../assets/progress/5/progress5_2.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
            I have since updated the deck with a little bit more cards, changed a few examples since the first version, and changed the note type a bit.<br>
            It also contains grammar cards before they're used in the sentence, to keep the learning progression very smooth.<br>
            Since a lot of work has been done with the grammar deck, I'll revise the deck again in the future so it can look a bit more like a "complete course".<br>
            However, since I'm also planning on making a course on the website, I'll have to plan ahead to see if both system can work together.<br>
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Grammar</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Grammar"> 
         <p> 
            I've been working on this grammar deck for a while now, adding more content and refining it everytime I complete a new resource. <br>
            This year, I used all the new anime content that I had and added anime example for all the grammar points.
            3 examples for each. So that's about 800 anime examples handpicked.
            <img src="../../assets/progress/5/progress5_3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="">
            Beause I got to look into my anki database for each grammar, I was a able to check each time the number of time it appears. <br>
            So you know have a frequency field for the deck. I can check how important the grammar is, or even order the cards by frequency if you want. <br>
            I also added the lessons from Tae Kim that's still very popular despite not being very good in my opinion. <br>
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Kana all in One</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Kana all in One"> 
         <p> 
            Not that important, but for the sake of completion, I've made a deck to learn kana and katakana.<br>
            I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible.           <br>
            <img src="../../assets/progress/5/progress5_4.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Video Games"> 
         <p> 
            Persona 5 was easy to dump. I tried playing 3 and 4 but it's just not my thing, so I won't make the complete deck.<br>
            Also it's more than 100 hours to complete ? Just no.<br>
            
            I did however Pokemon finished Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. <br>
            Pokemon is one of the easy games to play in japanese. This one is even easier than the main franchise.<br>         
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Yotsuba Vol 4</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Yotsuba Vol 4"> 
         <p> 
            Took me forever to make, but it's done.<br>
            I added it for free if you already bought volume 3.<br>
            Otherwise the price is the same.<br>
            It takes too much time to make, and I like them less than the video games ones as sutdy material, so that will probably be my last manga deck.    <br>    
          </p>
        </section>
        </section>

        <h2>SPREADHSEET</h2>   
        <section class="scrollable" id="SPREADHSEET"> 

        <h3>More decks</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="More decks"> 
         <p> 
            On top of my decks, I've also added those made by other people on the mediafire blog. <br>
            I don't if there less download than before, but what's clear is that there's almost no more deck being made now. <br>
            I usually only add decks from top rated anime, but reddit user Cacophony wanted to have a comprehensive list, so he took it on himself to add all the missing decks. <br>
            With annotations. I know first hand how much time it takes, so thanks to him, that's a lot of work. <br>
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>More Game Scripts</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Spreadhseet_Game Scripts"> 
         <p> 
            I've found, or just though of looking up some new games. <br>
            Story of Seasons, the mana games, Chrono Cross, Kingdom Hearts, Xenoblade, Nier, Monster Hunter... but especially the old but latest version of the Final Fantasy games. <br>
            The scripts before were based on old transcritp, sometimes without kanji. <br>
            With the new pixel remaster, you get to play the game in their arguably best version, but also, with a clean script. <br>
            Since the data was easy to dump, I've made some spreadsheet with eng and jap next to each other so you read as you play without the need of ocr. <br>
            If you've never played them go for it.

      <h2>WEBSITES</h2>  
      <section class="scrollable" id="WEBSITES">  
        <h3>Immersion Kit</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Immersion Kit"> 
         <p> 
            We've been talking about it for years now with Akira Sensei, the jrpg playing japanese teacher from Japanese Quest. <br>
            He wanted a database of anime / video games to showcase example for words or grammar using that native content. <br>
            But neither of us were tech savy to make that kind of thing. <br> <br>
            
            He mentionned it again on his discord and Purin reached out to me as we were in contact since I gave feedback for Game2text. <br>
            We joined forces and he made the website in only a few weeks using my content. <br>
            A database of native content accessible online, from your phone. Pretty cool. <br>
            <img src="../../assets/progress/5/progress5_6.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="">
            The website has a patreon if you want to support, but I want to point out that I'm not getting any of that money. <br>
            This, plus the fact that I don't have the time to participate further led to me not being involved with the website no more. <br>
            <br>
            One of the issue is that some sentences are not perfect. Bad translation or bad sync.<br>
            Since the decks were made with subs2srs, there are some bad cards. <br>
            It doesn't matter much when studying in Anki, as you can delete, suspend pick another card easily, but it can be frustrating on the website, so more adding content is not a priority right now. <br>
            I'd also point out that if you use Anki, you can also use it as a database, which is what I do. <br>
            Look up the manual for the way to do advanced searches. <br>
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>This website</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="This_website"> 
         <p> 
          I was using a google website to post links, tutorials and all that. But being limited by the possibilities, I started to look for other options. <br>
          So Unbound reached out on discord and made this website. <br>
          No, it's up to me to make the content and migrate what is on the google website to this one. <br>
          I'm pretty slow. <br>

        <h3>Game Scripts</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Wesbite_Game Scripts"> 
         <p> One of the things I couldn't have made before on the old site. <br>
           I made a html version of my anki decks so you can use Jrpg scripts as reading material.  <br>
          I got fancy considering my coding skills and added a button do hide and display the english sentences. <br>
            Since the text can be pretty long, I also added a table of content on the side so you can get to a part of the game more easily. <br>

        <h3>Guide and Tutorials</h3>
        <section class="scrollable" id="Tutorials"> 
         <p> As I'm rebuilding since website, it's going to give me the opportunity to update my previous guide. <br>
           I have more experience and knowledge now, there are also new tools, so I'll be sure to cover that. <br>
          </p>
         <p> I'm also going to revisit and add new tutorials, for Anki, Morphman, my readability files, subs2srs and all that. <br>
          If you have any proposition, don't hesitate to reach out. <br>

      <h3>Project - Anime Course</h3>
      <section class="scrollable" id="Project - Anime Course"> 
        <p>
          I have two major projects for 2022. No idea if I'll see them to completion. <br>
          The first one is to keep working on the grammar deck.  <br>
          I'm going through Cure Dolly right now, and as expected, the more logical approach means that I'll restructure everything and build better foundation. <br>
          <br>
          Once I'm done I'll finally be able to build a grammar guide on my own. <br>
          Tae Kim is still the main resource recommended unfortunately and I think we can do better. <br>
          We can improve the structure of the course, have better explanation, especially compared to Cure Dolly, and use native examples. <br>
          As a mean time I added the grammar dump of my anki deck. So you can a page with all the grammar references for easy look up. <br>
        </p>

      <h3>Project - Reading course</h3>
      <section class="scrollable" id="Tutorials"> 
          <p>
            Since I understand it can be boring to build up grammar, I'm designing a second course so you can get to it asap. <br>
            The course will be based on reading with jrpg material. <br> 
            I'll provide a list of vocabulary and grammar to learn, and the introduction of the game. <br>
            I'll go over each line and explain what's going on.<br>
            I'll organize everything so you only have a few words to learn, and then be able to read a chapter, or story, or beginning of a game.<br>
            To make this possible, I added the japanese folklore short stories to the readability list, all manga from the late bilingualmanga.com, and the scripts for 50 jrpgs.<br>
            Therefore a lot of popular games scripts have been added to the spreadsheet, and I followed the poll that I've made and many answered for their favourite games.<br>
            Thanks to those who participated bloodborn and other stuff I wouldn't have considered otherwise are included.            <br>
