          <h1>Anime Difficulty</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The main idea for the readability list was to create files that would make it easy to spot the next anime
            (or manga, games...) that has the closest vocabulary from what you already know, making the transition to a
            new title easier. Using Morphman, I was able to create benchmarks for popular resources. On that list, if
            you're looking for a show to watch, you can simply use the Readability List tab on my spreadhseet. Titles
            recommended for beginners are in bold. Howewer these suggestions, are only based on usual recommendations
            and are subjective. If think they're still valid, because no amount of data can simply put one objective
            difficulty grade for a show. So I think it's still the best way to go, but I would point out that you should
            watch something you enjoy regardless of difficulty. But if you have interest in data like me, I'll go over
            the numbers that we can use to measure the difficulty of a show.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="issues">
          <h2>Issues</h2>
          <h3>Different times, different results</h3>
          <p>
            Ideally, you could simply put a grade to each between 1 and 10 based on the data, and call it a day.
            Unfortunately it just doesn't work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main problem is that each shows have different runtimes. More time means more sentences, which means
            more words. Problem is, it has a huge impact on the data you collect because of how languages work. Think
            about the first 20 minutes of a show, a lot of new words will show up. Now add another 20 minutes, you'll
            have more new words, but less than during the first 20 minutes, because you'll reuse some of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point is you can't simply divide the number of new words by 2 to get an average, because it's not
            proportional.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="target">
          <h2>Target%</h2>
          <p>
            Using Morphman, we can analyze how many words we need to know to achieve x% of comprehension of a show. In
            this case, comprehension is achieved by knowing the vocabulary used in the show. So Target=85% means that
            you want to know 85% of the Total Instances (TI). Those words are of course organized by the frequency of
            that show.
