        <section id="about_the_guide">
          <h2>About the guide</h2>
            <p>
             I'm fully aware that's there's a <b>lot</b> of guides, tips, advices, articles, tweets, posts, videos 
             ... about how to learn japanese. As a beginner, it can be <b>overwhelming</b>, and you're not really sure where to begin. 
             <br />
             That's where this guide comes in.
              <br />
              <b>This is not a guide to learn japanese but a guide about how to learn japanese. </b>
           </p>
        </section>   
          
        <section id="best_way">
          <h2>What's the best way to learn japanese ?</h2>
           <p>
             Good news: <b>there isn't one</b>, so you don't have to worry about learning the wrong way.
             <br />
             I've seen countless people say that they struggle or even stopped to learn japanese because using one of those so called 
             "best way to learn japanese" didn't didn't work for them, and they got demotivated.
              <br />
              That's why I don't really like the guides that try to sell you a unique method or pathway.
              <br />
              We all have different tastes, interests and amount of free time for one method to apply to us all.
           </p><br />

            <p>
              So, this guide won't tell you what to do, but will show you a <b>list of the most
              popular tools and resources</b> that we have at our disposal.
              <br>
              I'll explain <b>advantages and disadvantages for each of them</b> and can you pick the ones that suits you the best.
            </p><br />

            <p>
             If you're interested, here's a short video from someone who actually studied if polyglottes have a common "best" 
              method to learn languages.<br>
              <small>(Spoiler: they just make learning fun and keep at it).</small><br>

            </p><br />

           <p>
             I'm biased to some resources, of course, but I try to be honest and subjective. I'm sure some people would
             disagree with me when it comes to kanji and immersion, but that's okay. 
             <br>
             Keep in mind that the list of
              methods in this guide is not exhaustive, you can obviously study in ways that are not presented here.

        <section id="what_to_learn">
          <h2>What's to learn ?</h2> 
           <p>In the end, japanese is no different than any languages. You have 4 skills that you can develop:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Input</li>
             <ul>
               <li>Listening</li>
               <li>Reading</li>
             </ul>
             <li>Output</li>
             <ul>
               <li>Speaking</li>
               <li>Writing</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
            - You'll need to study <b>grammar</b> (including conjugation), and <b>vocabulary</b>.  
            <br /> - The only thing specific about japanase is that you need to learn <b>kana</b>. Unlike the alphabet for english, 
            if you know those 
            46 kana, you can read any japanese word, as they're always pronouced the same.
            <br /> - There also some 2000 common <b>kanji</b>. Learning them can be confusing and frustrating, but you can simply think of them
            as vocabulary to learn.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            All the resources that will be mentionned on this guide are listed on my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukDIWSkh_xvpppPbgs1nUR2kaEwFaWlsJgZUlb9LuTs/edit#gid=818343474"

            spreadsheet</a>, so you can just read the guide to get an overview,

          <section id="Don't_get_lost_or_demotivated">
            <h2>Don't get lost or demotivated</h2>
              <h3>Set up your goal</h3>
                <p>Not everybody wants to study japanase for the same reasons. Find some goals that works for you.</p>
                <p>When you feel demotivated, remind yourself why you started in the first.</p>
              <h3>Set smaller goals to keep track of progress</h3>
                <p>
                  Learning a language is a long road. Divide it into some smaller goals and track your progress. It will give
                  you a sense a progression.
                </p> 
                <p>
                  When feeling demotivated you can look back at all the things you have already
                  achieved.
                </p>
              <h3>Don't compare yourself to others</h3>
                <p>
                  You don't fail because others are going faster than you. You still going faster than anyone who didn't even
                  try or gave up. Either way, nobody can study for you anyway. Focus on your own progress.

          <section id="Terms">
              <h2>Terms that will be used in this guide</h2>
              <h3>Frequency</h3>
              <p>
                Frequency refers to how often something happenens over a limited period of time. Usually how often do you
                see a word / kanji in an episode or a book. </br>
                Using a frequency list will make sure you focus on the most important words instead of learning vocabulary that 
                will appear just once.
              </p>
              <h3>SRS</h3>
              <p>
                Spaced repetition system. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while
                older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently. </br>
                This way you can make your study sessions more efficient.
              </p>
              <h3>Anki</h3>
              <p>
                Free SRS software. </br>
                Basically a flashcards software, but it can do so much more when you install the addons, especially Morphman.</br> 
                It's the number one resource for language learning. Most of the content I create is for Anki.

          <section id="Useful_Tools">
              <h2>Useful Tools</h2>
              <h3>Web plugins to translate every word</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10ten-ja-reader/" target="_blank">10ten Reader</a> (mozilla)
                 or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp" target="_blank">
                   Rikaikun</a> (Chrome) are web plugins allowing you to have a pop up dictionary by hovering over words or kanji.</br>
                Don't forget that you can open any text file (like subtiltes) in a browser, making it easier to read japanese.
              </p>
              <h3>Jp / Eng dictionary</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">Jisho</a> is the most commonly used. </br>
                Take 2 minutes to read the
                instructions on the website. You can set up your searches in a lot of ways.
              </p>
              <h3>Website to translate whole sentences (with conjugations)</h3>
              <p>
                Instead of looking up words one by one, translate the whole sentence at once with
                <a href="https://ichi.moe/" target="_blank">ichi.moe</a>. Every word will be given the kanji, kana, romaji
                and definition. </br>
                Works with conjugation way better than jisho.
              </p>
              <h3>Create a Frequency list from almost anything</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/japanesetextana/" target="_blank">Japanese Text Analysis</a>. A
                bit old but still the best option to create frequency list on the fly. Otherwise, use Morphman's Analyzer.

            <section id="before-you-start">
              <h2>General tips before you start</h2>
              <h3>Grammar, kanji, vocabulary or conjugation or ... ?</h3>
              <p>
                At the start, try to mix them up.
                You'll remember a kanji better if it's used in a word.
                You'll learn vocabulary and grammar better in a context of a sentence. </br>
                You can focus more on a specific field, but don't put any of them on the side until you have "finished" one.
              </p>
              <h3>Use the Resources pages</h3>
              <p>
                You can find them on <a href="../resources/Resources_index.html">this page</a> and in a
                <a
                  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukDIWSkh_xvpppPbgs1nUR2kaEwFaWlsJgZUlb9LuTs/edit#gid=818343474"
                  target="_blank" >google spreadsheet</a>
                that you can filter depending on your level or what you want to focus on. The list is small. You can always
                search on reddit for more.
              </p>
              <h3>Search before you ask</h3>
              <p>
                If you're looking for something or have a question, chances are it's been asked and answered on
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
                before. Just look for it before asking. It's faster to find an answer than waiting for one.
