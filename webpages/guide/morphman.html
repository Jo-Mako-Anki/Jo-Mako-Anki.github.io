          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I wouldn`t say that Morphman is essential to your studies, but if you already use Anki you might consider
            using Morphman. It might seem scary at first, but I can help you set it up in 5 minutes, if you follow this
            guide.
            <br />
            <!-- line break -->
            Here's a recap of all the cool things you can do with it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At any point during your studies you know exactly how many words you`ve learned.</li>
            <li>
              You know the exact percentage of a title you understand, helping you find something with the right
              difficulty for you.
            </li>
            <li>You can set the exact comprehension percentage of some material for your next study.</li>
            <li>
              You know the amount of words you need to learn, to reach your next goal, and Morphman will prioritize them
              automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can filter those words by a master frequency list, making sure you still focus on the most frequent
              words in japanese, and not just the words used in a certain show.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Mecab is used to help Morphman analyze the sentences with better accuracy. There's a
            <b> Mecab update</b> that you can get

          <p>
            Drag and drop all the files in update archive to your Mecab folder (named 13462835), replace all the files
            when asked to.

        <section class="scrollable" id="what-morphman-needs">
          <h2>What morphman needs</h2>
          <p>Morphman can build a database of words you know, but to do this you need to specify where they are.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Morphman doesn't analyze decks, it analyzes <b> fields</b>. So you need to know which field to look at,
            because analyzing a field where you have some english text won't do anything. You want to analyze the field
            with the japanese sentence or word that you've learned. You just need to know which <b>note type</b> that
            field is.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're unsure about note style, field, cards and all that, go back to the
            <a href="" target="_blank">Anki tutorial</a>.
          </p>
          <span class="note"
            >Note: Morphman is for words, not Kanji. You can't use it on a Kanji deck, simply because single kanji are
            not words.</span
          >

          <p>
            For Morphman to work, you need to tell it which cards to analyze. For this, you need to know the
            <b> note type</b> of the card. But Morphman doesn't analyze the whole card, only a field so you also need to
            know which field of that note type to analyze. Basically, where you have the sentence or word in japanese.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can analyze more than one note type, which we'll do in this tutorial, but each time you just need to
            need to know 2 things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your note type</li>
            <li>The name of the field you want to analyze</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you want to only analyze your cards, that's all you need to know.</p>
          <p>
            If you wish to modify your cards, so they can be reorganized in
            <b> +1 order </b>, you need to have <b> a field </b> where Morphman will put the word you don't know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Morphman preferences depend on the name of
            <b> YOUR NOTE STYLE </b> and <b> YOUR FIELDS </b>, so don't copy my settings exactly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="scrollable" id="which-note-type">
          <h2>Which note type?</h2>
          <p>
            Go to the browser mode <kbd>B</kbd>. You can see the list of your note types on the left, and if you click
            on it, you'll see which notes are in there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let's say that I have just finished the Core Anime Deck, and I want Morphman to tell me how many words
            I already know. In this case the note type I'll use is "Japanese Core Anime Vocabulary".
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also go directly to manage note type
            <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>, and to check the name of the note type you're using.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="scrollable" id="which-field-to-analyze">
          <h2>Which field to analyze?</h2>
          <p>In this case, my sentence is in the field called "Expression".</p>
          <p>
            That's for this note type only. For the other note types, the field that you want to analyze could be named
            Front, Word, Morph, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just click on the name of the field and copy it, so you know there won't be a spelling mistake when you have
            to write it.

        <section class="scrollable" id="note-filter">
          <h2>Note filter</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Note Type: Pick your note type from the list. In my case, it's "Japanese Core Anime Vocabulary".</li>
            <li>
              If you want Morphman to only use some specific cards from that note type, tag those cards, and put the
              name of that tag in that column.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put the name of the field you want to analyze. <b>No typos</b>, that's why I said you could copy from the
              browser. Paste or write it here. Mine is "Expression".
            </li>
            <li>Pick "Japanese Mecab ..." as your Morphemizer. We didn't download it for nothing.</li>
            <li>
              Check the Read box, if you want Morphman to collect data only from the cards, to build a database of your
              knowledge. That's what we want to use Morphman for afterall.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check the Modify Box if you want Morphman to reorganize your cards in +1 order. I didn`t check it here,
              because The Core Anime deck is already in +1 order, Morphman will mess around with the cards and we don't
              want that for this deck. If you're using the tango decks, you probably don't need to change the card order
              either. We'll do it with the deck for A Silent Voice below.
            </li>
            <li>Click apply</li>
            <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman6.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
            <p>
              Now, the only thing you have to do is recalc
              <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>
              your database. You'll see the number of your known words change at the top of Anki.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
            <span class="note">
              Note that the deck or mecab may change between the moment I write this tutorial and the time you do it, so
              the numbers may be different.
            </span>
            <p>Morphman counts words in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>K: Number of Known words (Ex ね and ねぇ count as 1 word)</li>
              <li>V: Number of Known words - with iterations (Ex ね and ねぇ count as 2 words)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, that I know how many words I know, I want to keep studying with the Deck for A Silent Voice.</p>
            <p>
              Morphman can analyze more than one field at a time, so we`ll do just that. The process is the same, you
              need to know the field and the note type to analyze.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you, go back to Morphman's option <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
              and click on Clone to add another line.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman8.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
            <p>
              The deck for A Silent Voice is in chronological order. To change the order, this time you need to check
              the modify box. So, you'll be able see the sentences with only one unkown word, they are called i+1.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll see in the next section of the tutorial how to be more precise with the order by using frequency
              lists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's check out the rest of the options because we need them in order to modify the order of the cards.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="scrollable" id="extra-fields">
          <h2>Extra Fields</h2>
          <p>
            I just said that Morphman can reorder any deck in a +1 manner, but to do that you need to have a field where
            that +1 word (the word that you don't know) is going to go.
          </p>
          <span class="note">
            This is required for every note type where you have checked the
            <b> modify box.</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            In addition to that field, you can also create more fields where Morphman will automatically write some
            data. It's optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to tell Morphman in which field the information is going to go by simply writing it in the boxes.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Focus morph (*). This is where the unknown word of your sentence goes. (By default, it's focus, I named my
              field "Morph", so that's what I'm putting this here).
            </li>
            <li>
              Index is basically Morphman's order, the higher the score, the sooner you'll see the card, but you have
              the due column for that anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
              The next 4 columns tell you how many unknown words there are in your note and what they are. The unmatures
              are the words you have seen but don't know very well yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unknown frequency can be useful. It tells you how many times in your collection the "Morph" word appears.
              When I say in your collection, it only applies to the decks you analyze with Morphman. This number has
              nothing to do with the outside frequency files, it only applies to your present database in Anki.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus morph POS, I found it useful when making my core2k deck. It tells you the grammatical nature of your
              "Morph". Same Morph can have differents ones, this specifies which one you're studying. Problem is that
              it's written in Japanese.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              Fresh and comprehension mean that you've seen all the words in that sentence. So the 1T note became 0T,
              meaning 0 unknown word. Comprehension means that one new word has matured, fresh means it hasn't yet, you
              saw it for the first time recently.

            <li>
              Not ready is for sentences that have more that 1 unkown word in the sentence. So 2T or more if you will.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Already known</b> is very useful if you studied with Anki before using Morphman. You can use those tag
              to tell Morphman you already know those cards without reviewing the cards first. The tag by itself is not
              enough, make sure the note types and fields of the cards you tag are analyzed by morphman in the Note
              Filter.
            </li>
            <li>
              You prioritize your words if you have a priority database. It's not really useful, Frequency works better.
            </li>
            <li>
              Too Short and Too Long is important, you can use those tags to know if the sentence of your note is ...
              you guessed it: too long or too short. See below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Frequency is also useful, it will tell you if the morph on your 1T card is included in your frequency
              file. See next page for frequency.

          <h2>General</h2>
          <p>
            Let's get pratical and win some time with our studies. The example below is if I haven`t learned anything
            before using the
            <b> "A Silent Voice" </b> deck.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this screeshot, I use the
            <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874215009" target="_blank">advanced browser add-on</a>
            to see more columns in the browser and created the<i> UnknownFreq</i>
            field in the note type (see
            <a href="#extra-fields">Extra Fields</a> above).
          </p>
          <p>Couple of observations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cards are organized by Due Date here. Without using a frequency list, Morphman will order words by
              frequency of appearence in your collection. In this case, this means 何 appears 93 times in "A Silent
              Voice", な appears 75 times and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
              I don't have 0T cards as I don't know anything. So 1T cards are first. More than 1T cards are at the
              bottom, because you're not ready to learn them.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can see that the sentences are just one word. (Expression column). Some sentences are longer but they
              are names put in brackets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Those cards should be tags are <i>mm_tooShort</i>, but I changed the options to show you this ones first.
            </li>
            <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman13.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
            <li>Now, my first card should be "A_KoenoKatachi_0570" where I'd learn 何.</li>
            <li>
              I pass the card. The next one should be "A_KoenoKatachi_1037". But it's the same morph : 何. So maybe I
              don't want to lose time to see that card because, I`ve already picked a card I'm gonna use it to learn
              that word.
            </li>
            <li>
              So if I want to move on to learn な and change my second card instead to be A_KoenoKatachi_1031, use this
              option:
            </li>
            <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman14.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
          </ul>
          <p>
            Maybe you didn't see this morph today, but you still don't want to learn additional 0T for 何 cards when you
            already have one designated for that, you can check the first two boxes as well. The difference is wether or
            not 何 would be consider as Fresh or Mature morph.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman15.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Include all missing morphemes, will add morphemes to your frequency list that weren't included because of
              your study plan settings. See next section for that.
            </li>
            <li>You can choose to ignore morphemes that are categorized as grammar points.</li>
            <li>
              You can ignore what's in the brackets in your sentences. So if it's a word you don't know but it's in the
              brackets, Morphman won't count that word as a Morph. This option may unlock cards as 1T if names are in
              the brackets like in the last 3 sentences in my example above. If you are using add-ons like Migaku for
              pitch accent or analyzing a field where you have furigana, you may want to check the brackets options.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case some names are not in the brackets, you can set proper nouns as known. So you won't have to learn
              names of characters of towns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do you remember that if you fail the cards too many times, they will become leeches? You can ignore those
              cards as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Click <i>Apply</i> and you are done here.</p>
          <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman16.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />

          <h2 id="morphman-config-py">Morphman's config.py</h2>
          <p>
            There's one last thing to configure. Go to your add-ons window, select Morphman, and click on View files.
            That takes you the Morphman add-on directory.
          </p>
          <p>Open the "Morph folder" and open<i> config.py </i> with any notepad.</p>
          <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman17.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />

          <h3>Comprehension and fresh</h3>
          <p>
            So those comprehension and fresh morph we mentioned above, you can say to Morphman which ones they are, and
            how long it takes for a fresh morph (known) to become a comprehension (mature) morph. You should leave those
            settings by default anyway, since it's recommended to skip those extra cards.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman20.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />

          <h3>Pick cards with a good sentence length</h3>
          <p>We all know that length matters, especially when you have to study japanese sentences.</p>
          <p>
            You can set the threshold for what is too short or too long. If the sentence doesn't fit it will get some
            minus points and will not be prioritizez, but they won't get suspended or anything. Morphman will just
            prioritize cards with proper length.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some prefer longer sentences to practice their listening skills since sentences in immersion are usually
            quite long. I like shorter sentences, because it makes it easier to recognize the morph that I don't know,
            and memorize it. It also makes the reviews faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find a balance that works for you. The numbers here apply to the number of Morphs (words) not characters.
          </p>

          <h3>Prioritize words on your frequency list</h3>
          <p>
            We'll learn about frequency list in the next section. You need to use it, if you want to prioritize learning
            words in that file.
          </p>
          <p>So make sure the number here is high enough so that they are prioritized higher in your queue list.</p>
          <span class="note">
            <p># Maximum bonus a card can get by its position in frequency.txt.</p>

            <p># A card with an unknown morph that matches the first word in frequency.txt will get all this bonus.</p>
            <p>
              # A card with an unkown morph that matches some of the last words in frequency.txt will get almost no

          <p>
            Maybe you'll change your setttings once in a while, that's okay, I did too, before I found the ones that
            worked for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use Anki just to be reminded of the vocab I know and keep it fresh in my head, but the real studying or
            practice takes place during immersion. It's by watching an anime, or most likely playing jrpgs that I really
            see my progress, or when I'm reading, and I don't need to check the definition of a word because I saw the
            card not too long ago. So I make sure I spend as little time as possible doing reviews to make them
            efficient. Short length, good cards to memorize, skip all the redundant 0T out of the process, disregard
            proper nouns and words in brackets.
          </p>
          <p>But that's just me. As always, figure out what works best for you.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="scrollable" id="right-card">
          <h3>Pick the right card</h3>
          <p>
            Unless you make your own cards, good chance you'll use
            <b>subs2srs</b>
            decks for anime. If that's the case, some cards are not that great because the progress is automatic. The
            screenshots don`t help, the audio is missing at the beginning or the end of the sentences...
          </p>
          <p>
            So when doing reviews, simply press <kbd>L</kbd>. It will show you all the others cards that have the same
            Morph. Use the preview button to check them out.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find a better card that the one Morphman gave you, select it, you can use Edit - Learn now
            <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or <i>Cards - Reposition</i>, and press <i>Ok</i>. I use the
            latter since there is a shortcut in the header.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/morphman/morphman22.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" />
        </section>

        <section class="scrollable" id="update-database">
          <h3>Update your database</h3>
          <p>
            Morphman doesn't update your database of known words automatically. You need to do it manually. Press
            <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe not very useful to do it every time you`ve learned a new card, but I do it at the end of my reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            So do your new cards for the day, recalc the database. In the header of the main screen you'll see the K and
            V numbers change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why two numbers ? It's because of iterations of the same word. So ね and ねぇ are the same word but written
            a bit differently. Think of "hey" and "heyyy".
          </p>
          <p>If that was the only know word your numbers would be this; K 1 (ね) and V 2 (ね and ねぇ).</p>
          <p>
            Overall the way of counting words is not perfect, so don't stress about it too much. When updating Mecab for
            example, your numbers may be lowered, but it doesn't mean that you`ve lost knowledge, it just means there's
            better accuracy.
